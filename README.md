## Description
C-Food is a command-line virtual recipe book. The app comes prepackaged with common recipes and some of our favourites. We plan on having a searchable index of recipes. 
Users will be able to search for a recipe based on: the recipe title, category tags, and the ingredients. We will also include the ability to add, edit and delete recipes, 
serving size adjustments, and unit conversions.

## Testing
This project is tested using Visual Studio Unit Testing framework. The code coverage reports are generated and uploaded to codecov at each push to the repository.

We will also make use of user testing to receive detailed feedback. The questionnaire for user testing can be found at the link below:
