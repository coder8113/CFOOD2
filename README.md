## Name
C-Food

## Description
C-Food is a command-line virtual recipe book. The app comes prepackaged with common recipes and some of our favourites. We plan on having a searchable index of recipes. 
Users will be able to search for a recipe based on: the recipe title, category tags, and the ingredients. We will also include the ability to add, edit and delete recipes, 
serving size adjustments, and unit conversions.

## Testing
This project is tested using Visual Studio Unit Testing framework. The code coverage reports are generated and uploaded to codecov at each push to the repository.

## Documentation
Documentation for this project was produced using doxygen. Our site can be viewed at: https://codedocs.xyz/coder8113/CFOOD2/index.html
